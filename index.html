            <p>If you want to be a successful web designer, a solid grasp of CSS is a must. Even if you don't do the coding yourself, understanding how it works will help you design for the web. We've built a comprehensive guide to help you learn CSS online, whether you're just getting started with the basics or you want to explore more advanced CSS. This Learning Guide will help you:</p>

            <ul>

               <li>Explore the most recent developments in CSS.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We'll start with a basic explanation of what CSS is and how it works. Then we'll get into the fundamentals of CSS, such as typography, layout, colors, and backgrounds.

            <h2>What Is CSS?</h2>

            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, documents that contain styling rules that describe how HTML elements are displayed. CSS allows you to control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>

            <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>

            <p>CSS works hand in hand with HTML; HTML sorts out the page structure, while CSS adds style, makes it look pretty, and allows you to introduce subtle levels of interaction.</p>

            <p>Multiple style rules can point to one HTML element, in which case there needs to be a way to determine which rule should take effect. The term cascading describes the process of filtering down from general rules, until the most specific rule is encountered. That rule is then chosen to do its work.</p>

            <p>CSS is read by web browsers. They take the HTML markup document, and then they apply the CSS styling rules to the elements within that document.</p>
